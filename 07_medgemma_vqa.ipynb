    "- How to **perform VQA and classification** using the `image-text-to-text` pipeline  \n",
    "- How to **store MedGemma’s output** back into your FiftyOne samples for analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "⚙️ **MedGemma quick facts**:\n",
    "- Developed by **Google**, MedGemma is built on Gemma 3 with a **SigLIP image encoder**\n",
